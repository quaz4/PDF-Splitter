# PDF Splitter

## Introduction

App used to help split up PDFs by either bulk naming or one by one.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v8.1.3
- Electron v6.0.2
- Electron Builder v21.2.0

Builds for Mac, Windows and Linux.

/!\ Angular 8.0 CLI needs Node 10.9 or later to work.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally :

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/quaz4/pdf-splitter.git
```

Install dependencies with npm :

``` bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` that are only used in electron on the backend when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.


If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

In a terminal window, run `npm start`

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.
